# Project Presentation: Software Development Current Event Topics

## Objective
Students will research and present a recent or ongoing current event related to software development. The goal is to demonstrate understanding of contemporary topics, improve research and communication skills, and utilize GitHub for collaborative project development and material organization.

## Project Requirements

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Topic** | Any current event related to software development (e.g., new programming languages, software engineering trends, major software company news, emerging tools, or ethical challenges in AI). |
| **Team Size** | 3–4 students per group |
| **Presentation Format** | Pre-recorded **YouTube video** (Time: **2:30–3:00 minutes**) |
| **Presentation Style** | Freestyle: Use any method (e.g., live recording, PowerPoint voiceover, screen recording) <br>**Note**: No AI-generated voices allowed |
| **GitHub Use** | All project work (scripts, slides, media assets, documentation, etc.) must be uploaded to **GitHub**. Collaboration history (commits, issues, pull requests) will be assessed. |
| **Class Interaction** | Each group must end their video with **one thought-provoking test question** related to their topic. <br>Each student (individually) must **comment or answer questions** posed by other groups. |
| **Grading Breakdown** | Total: **10% of final grade**<br>• 8% – Group Presentation (video + GitHub usage)<br>• 2% – Engagement (answers/comments on peers' questions) |

## GitHub Best Practices for the Project

- Create a `README.md` file with:
  - Project title, team members name and student number
  - Topic summary
  - Link to YouTube video
  - Final question
- Use GitHub Issues to track tasks (e.g., script writing, editing, voiceover).
- Assign roles clearly and document contributions.
- Commit regularly – avoid a single last-minute upload.
- Create branches and use pull requests if possible.

## Submission Format

- GitHub repository URL with all project materials.
- Public YouTube video link embedded in the README.
- Final question written at the end of the video and in the README.
