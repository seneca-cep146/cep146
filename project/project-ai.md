# Project Presentation: Artificial Intelligence Current Event Topics

## Objective
Students will research and present a recent or ongoing current event related to artificial intelligence and machine learning. The goal is to demonstrate understanding of contemporary AI developments, improve research and communication skills, and utilize GitHub for collaborative project development and material organization.

## Project Requirements

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Topic** | Any current event related to artificial intelligence (e.g., breakthrough AI models, AI regulation and policy, ethical AI concerns, AI in healthcare/education/business, generative AI developments, or AI safety research). |
| **Team Size** | 3–4 students per group |
| **Presentation Format** | Pre-recorded **YouTube video** (Time: **2:30–3:00 minutes**) |
| **Presentation Style** | Freestyle: Use any method (e.g., live recording, PowerPoint voiceover, screen recording, demonstrations) <br>**Note**: No AI-generated voices allowed |
| **GitHub Use** | All project work (research documents, slides, demo code, media assets, documentation, etc.) must be uploaded to **GitHub**. Collaboration history (commits, discussion board, branches, issues, pull requests) will be assessed. |
| **Class Interaction** | Each group must end their video with **one thought-provoking discussion question** related to their AI topic. <br>Each student (individually) must **comment or answer questions** posed by other groups. |
| **Grading Breakdown** | Total: **10% of final grade**<br>• 8% – Group Presentation (video + GitHub usage)<br>• 2% – Engagement (answers/comments on peers' questions) |

## Deliverables Checklist

All items must be committed to the group's GitHub repository:

-  Research notes and source documentation
-  Video script or presentation outline
-  Visual slides or demonstration materials (if used)
-  Code examples or AI tool demonstrations (if applicable)
-  Final video YouTube link
-  Final discussion question for audience engagement
-  Evidence of collaboration (issues, commits, pull requests, etc.)

## GitHub Best Practices for the Project

- Create a comprehensive `README.md` file with:
  - Project title and team member details (names and student numbers)
  - AI topic summary and significance
  - Key findings and implications
  - Link to YouTube video
  - Final discussion question
  - References and sources used

- **Repository Structure:**
  ```
  /research-notes
  /presentation-materials
  /code-demos (if applicable)
  /media-assets
  README.md
  ```

- Use GitHub Issues to track tasks (e.g., research phases, script writing, video editing).
- Document individual contributions and assign clear roles.
- Commit regularly with meaningful commit messages.
- Use branches and pull requests for major contributions.
- Include a `SOURCES.md` file with all research references.

---

## Submission Requirements

- **Primary**: GitHub repository URL containing all project materials
- **Video**: Public YouTube video link embedded in README
- **Documentation**: Final discussion question prominently displayed in both video and README
- **Collaboration Evidence**: Clear GitHub history showing all team members' contributions

---

## Additional Considerations for AI Topics

- **Ethical Responsibility**: Present balanced viewpoints on controversial AI topics
- **Source Credibility**: Use reputable sources (academic papers, established tech publications, official company announcements)
- **Current Relevance**: Focus on events from the past 6-12 months
- **Impact Analysis**: Discuss broader implications beyond just technical details
- **Future Implications**: Consider and discuss potential long-term effects of the AI development you're presenting
