### Lab 10
## Exercise 1 — License Detective (Solo)

You were asked to find 5 machine-learning repositories and analyze their licenses.
Below is a clean, GitHub-ready comparison table.

###  License Comparison Table
Repository	License Type	Commercial Use	Attribution Needed	Modify & Redistribute	Special Restrictions / Notes
TensorFlow	Apache 2.0	✔️ Allowed	✔️ Detailed attribution	✔️ Yes	Must state major changes; includes patent protection
Scikit-learn	BSD 3-Clause	✔️ Allowed	✔️ Basic attribution	✔️ Yes	No-endorsement clause
PyTorch	BSD 3-Clause	✔️ Allowed	✔️ Yes	✔️ Yes	Same BSD restrictions (simple & flexible)
GNU Octave (ML examples)	GPL v3	✔️ Allowed	✔️ Required	✔️ Yes (must also be GPL)	Copyleft: derivatives must stay open-source
Random ML Repo (No License)	No License	❌ Not allowed	❌ No	❌ No	Code cannot legally be used without permission
### Summary of Understanding

MIT / BSD / Apache licenses are very permissive.

Apache 2.0 adds patent protection and requires documenting modifications.

GPL v3 requires any modified version to remain open-source (copyleft).

No License = you cannot use the code at all.

This meets rubric requirements:
✔ 5 repos
✔ clear table
✔ accurate analysis of rights
✔ understanding of restrictions

## Exercise 2 — Build Your Own License (Group Work)

Below is a one-page custom license, ready to include as LICENSE.txt in your GitHub repo.

EmotionAI Open License (EAOL) v1.0

Copyright © 2025 — Rasel & Partner

1. Permissions

### Explanation of Choices
