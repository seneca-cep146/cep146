### Lab 10

## Introduction
Your instructor will Show how to identify and interpret a software license on GitHub.

### **Exercise 1: License Detective (Solo)**
**Objective:** Learn to identify and understand different software licenses

**Instructions:**
1. Visit GitHub.com and search for "machine learning" repositories
2. Find 5 different projects and identify their licenses
3. For each project, answer:
   - What type of license is it? (MIT, Apache, GPL, BSD, etc.)
   - Can you use it commercially?
   - Do you need to attribute the original creators?
   - Can you modify and redistribute it?
   - Any special requirements or restrictions?
4. Create a simple comparison table

**Sample Answer Guide:**
- **MIT License:** Yes to commercial use, basic attribution required, can modify/redistribute freely
- **Apache 2.0:** Yes to commercial use, detailed attribution required, note changes made, patent protection included
- **BSD (2-clause):** Yes to commercial use, basic attribution required, maximum freedom
- **GPL:** Commercial use allowed but derivative works must also be GPL (copyleft)
- **Proprietary/No License:** Cannot use without explicit permission

### **Exercise 2: Build Your Own License (Groups of 2)**
**Objective:** Understand license components by creating a custom license

**Scenario:**
Your team has developed an innovative AI model for recognizing emotions in text. You want to share it with the world but need to decide on licensing terms.

**Task:**
Create a simple license that addresses:
1. Who can use your AI model?
2. What can they do with it? (modify, redistribute, commercial use?)
3. What must they do? (attribution, share improvements?)
4. What are they prohibited from doing?
5. What happens if they violate the license?

**Deliverable:**
- One-page license document
- Brief explanation of your choices

# Lab Rubric

**Total Points: 2 marks**

For this lab to be considered complete, students must successfully demonstrate understanding of software licensing through research analysis and practical license creation across two complementary exercises.

## Detailed Expectations:

### Exercise 1 Requirements (License Detective - Solo):
- Successfully identified 5 different machine learning repositories on GitHub with varied license types
- Created comparison table accurately categorizing license types (MIT, Apache, GPL, BSD, etc.)
- Correctly answered all 4 key questions for each project:
  - Commercial use permissions (yes/no with accuracy)
  - Attribution requirements (specific details)
  - Modification and redistribution rights (clear understanding)
  - Special requirements or restrictions (identified correctly)
- Demonstrated understanding of license differences through accurate analysis
- Table format should be clear and organized for easy comparison

### Exercise 2 Requirements (Build Your Own License - Groups of 2):
- **Custom License Document:** Created comprehensive one-page license addressing all 5 required components:
  - User permissions (who can use the AI model)
  - Usage rights (modification, redistribution, commercial use policies)
  - User obligations (attribution, improvement sharing requirements)
  - Prohibited activities (clear restrictions)
  - Violation consequences (enforcement mechanisms)
- **Explanation Component:** Provided thoughtful brief explanation justifying licensing choices with reasoning
- Demonstrated understanding of license design principles and trade-offs
- Showed evidence of collaborative work with partner

## Assessment Rubric:

| Criteria | Poor - 0 marks | Fair - 1 mark | Good - 2 marks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lab Completion | Failed to complete license identification research or did not create custom license, showing minimal understanding of licensing concepts | Successfully completed license research (Exercise 1) with mostly accurate analysis OR created custom license (Exercise 2) with basic components, but explanation portion was either non-existent or lacked depth (superficial reasoning, missing key licensing considerations, or incomplete analysis) | Successfully completed both license research (Exercise 1) with accurate comparison table and detailed analysis AND custom license creation (Exercise 2) with comprehensive document addressing all components, plus provided thoughtful explanation demonstrating clear understanding of licensing principles and strategic considerations |
