## Introduction
Your instructor will demonstrate structured Markdown with headings, subheadings, numbered lists, and bold tips.

**Estimated Time: 20-25 minutes**

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Formatting
Create a short introduction about yourself using:
- One main heading
- Bold text for your name
- Italic text for your favorite hobby
- A list of three things you enjoy doing

### Exercise 2: Recipe Card
Write a recipe using:
- A main heading for the recipe name
- A subheading for ingredients

- Bold text for important cooking tips

### Exercise 3: Academic Integrity Policy Document
Visit the [Seneca Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html) and create your own markdown version of the document.

**Instructions:**
1. Copy and paste the content from the website
2. Convert it to proper markdown format
3. Include content from the **beginning through the "Sanctions" section only**
4. Your markdown document should include:
   - Multiple heading levels (H1, H2, H3)
   - A blockquote for the academic integrity definition
   - Bold text for key terms
   - A bulleted list for the policy sections
   - At least one table (use the procedure table from Appendix A)
   - Links to related resources or policies mentioned

**Focus Areas:**
- **Purpose** section
- **Key definitions** (use blockquote for the main academic integrity definition)
- **Policy** sections 1-4 (General, Academic integrity program, Responsibilities, Sanctions)
- **One table** from the procedures section
- **Related links** at the bottom

**Tips:**
- Use `#` for main headings, `##` for subheadings, `###` for sub-subheadings
- Use `>` for blockquotes
- Use `**text**` for bold formatting
- Use `- ` for bullet points
- Use `[Link Text](URL)` for links
- For tables, use the pipe `|` character to separate columns
