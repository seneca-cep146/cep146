## Introduction


## Exercise 1: Create Your Personal Assistant Agent with Poe (Solo)

### Objective
Create a personalized AI agent using Poe by Quora that helps with a specific area of your life.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Getting Started with Poe
1. **Visit Poe website:** Go to poe.com in your web browser
2. **Create free account:** Click "Sign up" and use your email or Google account
3. **Explore the interface:** Familiarize yourself with the chat interface

#### Creating Your First Agent
1. **Click "Create Bot"** (look for the "+" button or "Create" option)
2. **Choose your bot type:** Select "Custom Bot" for full control
3. **Fill in basic information:**
   - **Bot Name:** Give it a clear, descriptive name (e.g., "StudyBuddy", "FitnessPal")
   - **Description:** Brief explanation of what your bot does
   - **Avatar:** Choose an appropriate icon or image

#### Writing Your Agent's Prompt
4. **Write the system prompt:** This is the most important step. In the "Prompt" field, write detailed instructions:

**Example for a Meal Planning Agent:**
```
You are MealMaster, a friendly meal planning assistant. Your job is to:
- Help users plan healthy, budget-friendly meals
- Suggest recipes based on available ingredients
- Consider dietary restrictions and preferences
- Provide shopping lists when requested
- Always ask about budget, dietary needs, and cooking skill level first

Keep your responses encouraging and practical. If you don't know something, say so and offer to help find alternatives.
```

5. **Set additional parameters:**
   - **Base Model:** Choose Claude or GPT (both work well)
   - **Temperature:** Set to 0.7 for balanced creativity
   - **Max tokens:** Leave at default

#### Testing Your Agent
6. **Save and test:** Click "Create Bot" to save
7. **Start a conversation:** Test with questions like:
   - "Help me plan meals for this week"
   - "I have chicken and vegetables, what can I make?"
   - "I'm on a tight budget, any suggestions?"

#### Refining Your Agent
8. **Edit if needed:** Go back to "Edit Bot" if responses aren't what you expected
9. **Adjust the prompt:** Make it more specific or add new rules
10. **Test again:** Continue refining until you're satisfied

### Example Focus Areas:
- **Study Helper:** Creates study schedules and explains difficult concepts
- **Fitness Coach:** Designs workout routines and tracks progress
- **Budget Advisor:** Helps with saving money and expense tracking
- **Language Tutor:** Practices conversations in different languages

### Deliverable
Share your agent's name, purpose, and demonstrate one to tow conversation.

## Exercise 2: AI Agent Comparison Challenge with Poe (Pairs)

### Objective
Create two different AI agents with opposing approaches to the same task and compare their responses.

### Detailed Steps

#### Part 1: Planning
1. **Team up** with a classmate
2. **Choose a scenario:** Pick from examples below or create your own
3. **Define two opposite approaches:** Decide how your agents will differ

#### Part 2: Creating Agent 1
1. **Person A creates the first agent:**
   - Go to poe.com and click "Create Bot"
   - Name your agent to reflect its personality
   - Write a detailed prompt defining its approach

**Example - Conservative Travel Agent:**
```
You are SafeTraveler, a very cautious travel planning assistant. You:
- Always prioritize safety and comfort over adventure
- Recommend well-established, highly-rated destinations
- Suggest comprehensive travel insurance
- Prefer organized tours over independent travel
- Focus on minimizing risks and maximizing comfort
- Always ask about safety concerns first
```

#### Part 3: Creating Agent 2
2. **Person B creates the opposite agent:**
   - Create a new bot with contrasting personality
   - Make the prompt emphasize different values

**Example - Adventurous Travel Agent:**
```
You are AdventureSeeker, an exciting travel planning assistant. You:
- Love suggesting unique, off-the-beaten-path experiences
- Encourage trying new foods, activities, and cultures
- Recommend budget-friendly local options over tourist traps
- Suggest spontaneous activities and flexible itineraries
- Focus on creating memorable, authentic experiences
- Always ask about adventure preferences first
```

#### Part 4: Testing and Comparison
3. **Test both agents** with identical questions:
   - "Plan a weekend trip for me"
   - "I have $500 budget, where should I go?"
   - "What activities do you recommend?"

4. **Document the differences** in their responses

### Example Scenarios:
- **Strict vs. Flexible Study Planner**
- **Budget vs. Quality Shopping Assistant**
- **Conservative vs. Risky Investment Advisor**
- **Formal vs. Casual Communication Coach**

### Deliverable
Present a 2-minute comparison showing how the same question gets completely different answers from your two agents.


### Bonus Challenge
If you finish early, try making your agent available to classmates by sharing the Poe bot link!

# Lab Rubric

## Lab Requirements:
- **Exercise 1** requires creating a functional personal assistant agent on Poe with clear purpose, well-written system prompt, and demonstration of 1-2 conversations
- **Exercise 2** requires pairs to create two contrasting agents, test them with identical questions, and present a 2-minute comparison showing different responses

## Grading Criteria (Total: 2 marks)

| Criteria | Poor - 0 marks | Fair - 1 mark | Good - 2 marks |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lab Completion** | Major portions incomplete (no working agents created or missing demonstrations) **OR** agents lack clear purpose/functionality (vague prompts, no evidence of testing) | Successfully created at least one functional agent but missing key components (incomplete demonstrations, weak system prompts, or inadequate comparison in Exercise 2) | Successfully completed both exercises with well-designed agents that have clear purposes, effective system prompts, demonstrated conversations, and meaningful comparison analysis |

## Additional Notes:
- Agents must be functional and demonstrate understanding of prompt engineering principles
- Exercise 2 presentations should clearly show how different approaches lead to different outcomes
- Quality of system prompts and evidence of testing/refinement will be considered
