## Exercise 1: Your First Prompts

 **Scenario 1:**  Writing a polite email declining a party invitation

Poor Prompt:

Write an email saying I can’t go to a party.

Good Prompt:

Write a polite and friendly email declining a party invitation.
Mention that I appreciate being invited but have another commitment.
Keep the tone warm and respectful, and end with a kind wish for the event.

Comparison:

The poor prompt gives very little context, so the AI might generate a short or rude message (e.g., “I can’t come. Sorry.”).

The good prompt gives clear instructions about tone, purpose, and content, which helps the AI produce a polite, natural, and appropriate email.

**Scenario 2:** Understanding photosynthesis for a presentation

Prompt for Children:

Explain photosynthesis in simple terms for a group of 10-year-old students.
Use bullet points and include a short, fun story about how plants make food from sunlight.

Prompt for Adults:

Summarize how photosynthesis works for an adult audience using bullet points.
Include important terms like sunlight, chlorophyll, carbon dioxide, and oxygen.

Prompt for Experts:

Provide a detailed scientific explanation of photosynthesis, including the chemical equations and energy transfer process.
Write it as a paragraph suitable for a biology presentation.

**Scenario 3:** Recipe suggestions based on ingredients you have at home

Prompt:

I have chicken, spinach, garlic, rice, and soy sauce at home.
I prefer healthy, low-fat meals and I’m a beginner cook.
Suggest 3 easy dinner recipes with step-by-step instructions.

Explanation:
This prompt includes ingredients, dietary preference, and cooking skill level, so the AI can provide realistic and personalized recipes instead of random suggestions.

## Pair Discussion:

The clearer prompts provided more specific, useful, and natural results.

Missing information in poor prompts included tone, audience, purpose, and format.

To improve prompts, I can always add context, target audience, and expected output format.

## Exercise 2: Problem-Solving with AI

**Scenario A:** Event Planning

(Planning a company team-building event for 20 people with a $500 budget)

Step 1 – Start Broad:

Suggest fun and affordable team-building event ideas for 20 people with a total budget of $500.

Step 2 – Focus on Venue Options:

Give me 5 possible venues in Toronto for a 20-person team-building event that cost under $500 total. Include both indoor and outdoor options.

Step 3 – Plan Activities:

Suggest team-building activities that are fun, promote teamwork, and don’t need expensive equipment.

Step 4 – Refine the Schedule:

Create a one-day event schedule (9 AM to 5 PM) including activities, breaks, and meals that keep total costs under $500.

Step 5 – Final Touch:

Write an email invitation for staff, explaining the event details and encouraging participation in a positive tone.

Reasoning:
This strategy uses iterative prompting — starting broad, then refining step by step.
It ensures the event stays organized, affordable, and engaging.

**Scenario B:** Learning New Skills

(Learning basic photography to improve social media posts)

Step 1 – Assess Current Skill Level:

I’m a beginner at photography and I mostly use my smartphone.
Explain the basic camera settings — ISO, aperture, and shutter speed — in simple terms with examples.

Step 2 – Learn Progressively:

Create a 2-week photography learning plan with short daily lessons.
Each day should include a concept and a small practice activity for improving my social media photos.

Step 3 – Learn Through Different Formats:

Give me a beginner-friendly tutorial explaining how to take better portrait photos using natural light.
Then, provide a checklist I can follow while taking pictures.

Step 4 – Personalized Advice:

Based on my current level, give me 5 tips to improve my photo composition and lighting when using my phone indoors.

Step 5 – Practice Exercise:

Create 3 fun photography challenges I can do this weekend to practice framing, lighting, and focus.

Reasoning:
These prompts use progressive learning — from understanding basics → structured lessons → practice → personalized feedback.
They mix formats (tutorials, checklists, exercises) for better engagement and improvement.

**Scenario C:** Home Improvement Decision

(Choosing how to update a living room on a budget)

Step 1 – Explore Options:

I want to update my living room with a small budget of $300.
Suggest creative and affordable design ideas that can make it look more modern and cozy.

Step 2 – Compare Options:

Give me 3 different design styles (modern, cozy, minimalist) for a small living room.
Describe the color themes, furniture ideas, and decoration tips for each style.

Step 3 – Evaluate Practicality:

Compare the cost, effort, and overall look of each design style so I can decide which one fits my space and budget best.

Step 4 – Personalized Advice:

My living room has limited natural light. Suggest lighting ideas, color choices, and layout tips that can make it look brighter and more open.

Step 5 – Creative Guidance:

Suggest some DIY decoration ideas using items I might already have at home.

**Reasoning:**

These prompts help combine creative ideas with practical advice, so I can make budget-friendly decisions that still look stylish and personal.
