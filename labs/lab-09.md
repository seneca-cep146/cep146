## Exercise 1: Your First Prompts

### Individual Exercise
Try writing prompts for these scenarios. Test them with an AI tool if available:

1. **Scenario:** You want to write a polite email declining a party invitation
   - Write a poor prompt
   - Write a good prompt
   - Compare the potential results

2. **Scenario:** You need help understanding photosynthesis for a presentation
   - Create a prompt that specifies your audience (children, adults, experts)
   - Include the format you want (bullet points, story, diagram description)

3. **Scenario:** You want recipe suggestions based on ingredients you have at home
   - Write a prompt that includes your ingredients, dietary restrictions, and cooking skill level

### Pair Discussion
Share your prompts with a partner and discuss:
- Which prompts are clearer?
- What information might be missing?
- How could you improve them?

## Exercise 2: Problem-Solving with AI

### Group Exercise (2 people per group)

Choose one of these real-world scenarios and develop a comprehensive prompting strategy:

#### Scenario A: Event Planning
You're planning a company team-building event for 20 people with a $500 budget.
- Create a series of prompts to help you plan everything from venue to activities
- Consider using chain of thought and iterative refinement
- Think about what constraints and requirements you need to specify

#### Scenario B: Learning New Skills
You want to learn basic photography to improve your social media posts.
- Design prompts that would help you learn progressively
- Consider different formats (tutorials, checklists, practice exercises)
- Think about how to get personalized advice based on your current skill level

#### Scenario C: Home Improvement Decision
You need to choose between different options for updating your living room on a budget.
- Create prompts that help you evaluate options
- Consider how to get advice tailored to your specific situation
- Think about how to get both creative ideas and practical guidance

### Group Discussion
Each group presents their prompting strategy and explains their reasoning.

# Lab Rubric

**Total Points: 2 marks**

For this lab to be considered complete, students must successfully demonstrate understanding of effective AI prompting techniques through individual practice, collaborative analysis, and group problem-solving across two comprehensive exercises.

## Detailed Expectations:

### Exercise 1 Requirements (Your First Prompts):
- **Individual Component:** Successfully created both poor and good prompts for all 3 scenarios (email declining invitation, photosynthesis explanation, recipe suggestions)
- Demonstrated clear understanding of prompt quality differences through comparison
- Included specific details in good prompts: audience specification, format requirements, constraints (dietary restrictions, cooking skill level)
- **Pair Discussion Component:** Actively participated in partner discussion with constructive feedback on prompt clarity and completeness
- Provided specific suggestions for prompt improvement based on missing information or unclear elements

### Exercise 2 Requirements (Problem-Solving with AI):
- **Group Component:** Selected one scenario (Event Planning, Learning Photography, or Home Improvement) and developed comprehensive prompting strategy
- Demonstrated understanding of advanced prompting techniques: chain of thought reasoning, iterative refinement, constraint specification
- Created series of related prompts showing progression and strategic thinking
- Considered multiple aspects: requirements, constraints, personalization, format preferences
- **Group Presentation:** Clearly presented prompting strategy with logical reasoning and explanation of approach
- Participated constructively in discussion of other groups' strategies

### Overall Engagement Requirements:
- Active participation in both individual work and collaborative discussions
- Demonstrated understanding of prompting principles through practical application
- Showed ability to analyze and improve prompting effectiveness
- Evidence of thoughtful consideration of AI interaction strategies

## Assessment Rubric:

| Criteria | Poor - 0 marks | Fair - 1 mark | Good - 2 marks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lab Completion | Failed to complete individual prompting exercises or did not participate in group work, missing evidence of understanding basic prompting concepts | Successfully completed individual prompting practice (Exercise 1) OR group problem-solving strategy (Exercise 2), but discussions and reflections were either non-existent or lacked depth (superficial analysis, vague feedback, or minimal participation in collaborative elements) | Successfully completed both individual prompting practice (Exercise 1) with clear poor/good prompt comparisons AND group problem-solving strategy (Exercise 2) with comprehensive approach, plus demonstrated thoughtful engagement in discussions showing deep understanding of effective AI prompting principles |
